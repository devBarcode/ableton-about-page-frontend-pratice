### About this project
I'm Michele Quartararo, also know as "**BARCODE**" or "**CODICEaBARRE**" in italian.

As I'm learning CSS3 and HTML5 I've decided to test my skills by building a frontend project by the projects given by [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects). I'll add some JavaScript interaction to the project when I'll feel confident enough.

I called this Project "**IpsumMusic**".
